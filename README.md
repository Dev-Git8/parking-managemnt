  <h1>🅿️ Park-Ease</h1>
  <p><strong>A Modern, High-Performance Real-Time Parking Management System</strong></p>
</div>

---

**Park-Ease** is a scalable, real-time parking management platform built with modern web technologies. It features robust, database-backed session management, live slot synchronization via WebSockets, role-based access control, and a type-safe data layer using Prisma ORM.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Live Slot Status**: Real-time updates of parking slot availability across all active users using WebSockets.
- **Advanced Session Management**: Database-backed sessions supporting up to 5 simultaneous active devices per user, complete with automated eviction of the oldest sessions and secure session revocation.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Distinct workflows for **Customers** (booking slots), **Business Owners** (managing parking areas and slots), and **System Admins**.
- **Secure Authentication Flow**: Defends against XSS and CSRF using strictly in-memory access tokens and HttpOnly, Secure refresh cookies, coupled with automatic session restoration.
- **Micro-Reservations & Automation**: Support for precise, minute-based booking durations with an automated scheduler for immediate slot release upon booking expiration.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 19 (Vite)
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS & Vanilla CSS (with premium Micro-animations via Framer Motion)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Communication**: Axios, Socket.io-client

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js (Express.js 5)
- **ORM**: Prisma (Type-safe queries)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
- **Caching & Real-time**: Redis (Dockerized), Socket.io
- **Authentication**: JWT & Database-Backed Sessions
- **Cloud Media**: Cloudinary (Image Uploads)

## 🏗️ Infrastructure: Docker Containerization

Park-Ease relies on **Docker** to provide a consistent, isolated, and production-ready development environment. The entire infrastructure stack (PostgreSQL + Redis) is orchestrated via a single `docker-compose.yml` file.

- **Portability**: Start the database and cache layer without manual installations.
- **Persistence**: Volumes are configured to ensure data survives container restarts.

## 🛡️ Security & Authentication Architecture

Park-Ease employs a hybrid, multi-layered authentication strategy:

1. **Database-Backed Sessions**: Replaced stateless JWTs with stateful DB sessions, enforcing device limits (max 5) and 7-day lifespans.
2. **In-Memory Access Tokens**: Access tokens are kept strictly in JavaScript memory (never in `localStorage`) to defeat XSS.
3. **HttpOnly Cookies**: Refresh tokens reside in `Secure`, `HttpOnly` cookies, shielding them from client-side scripts.
4. **Concurrency-Aware Interceptors**: Custom Axios interceptors automatically queue and process token refreshes if multiple concurrent requests encounter an expired token.

## 📋 API Reference Summary

### 🔐 Authentication (`/api/auth`)
- `POST /register` - Register a new user
- `POST /login` - Login to receive an access token and HttpOnly refresh cookie
- `POST /refresh` - Renew the access token
- `POST /logout` - Revoke the current session
- `POST /logout-all` - Revoke all active sessions for the user

### 🏢 Business Management (`/api/business`)
- `POST /register` - Register a new parking business
- `GET /mine` - Retrieve the current user's business profile

### 🅿️ Slots (`/api/slots`)
- `GET /` - List all available parking slots (Public)
- `POST /` - Create a new parking slot (Business Owner)
